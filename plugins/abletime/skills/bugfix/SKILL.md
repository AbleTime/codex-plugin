# Bugfix

Fix the task. Open the PR. Then `notify`.

## Instructions

1. Read the task with `get_task`. The task is the scope. Do not expand it.
2. Apply the fix in this repo. Follow the repo's existing rules. Leave a test when the change is functional.
3. Open a pull request for that fix.
4. Call `notify` with `title`, `body`, and `timeflowTaskId` of that task. That is how the person hears the fix is up. Do not use chat as the notify.
